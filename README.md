## What is BugReport?
BugReport is a tool that helps server owners manage any bug reports found by players which can be accessed by a GUI. This is especially helpful as information about where the player is located and their UUID is automatically stored and shown to admins.

## Commands
- **bugreport <message>** - Adds a new bug report.
- **buglist** - Shows a GUI with all the reports made.
- **buglinkdiscord <Webhook URL>** - Link a Discord Webhook to send all Bug Reports to.
## Permissions
- **bugreport.admin** - Allows a user to access the buglist command.
- **bugreport.notify** - Allows a player be notified every time a bug report is sent.
